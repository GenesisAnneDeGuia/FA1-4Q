<h1>Room to Read: A Charity Organization for Education</h1>
<p>World change starts with educated children. Room to Read addresses both access to education and quality of education, meeting children's learning needs both in and out of the classroom. I chose to support this organization because of what it stood for. Education is something that is, unfortunately, almost always out of reach from adults and children alike. Gender equality is also something that many face within the walls of education, with many women facing criticism for pursuing an "ambitious" career. This organization promotes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Literacy</b></li>
        <p>Supporting children in developing literacy skills with a love of reading.</p>
    <li><b>Gender Equality</b></li>
        <p>Supporting adolescents, particularly girls, in developing life skills that promote gender equality.</p>
    <li><b>Poverty Alleviation</b></li>
        <p>If historically low-income countries were to reach their goal of universal secondary education by 2030, then by 2050, per capita earnings would increase by 75%, thereby lifting 60 million people out of poverty. Over 40 years, income per capita is 23% higher in a country with more equal education.</p>
</ul>

<p>Would we rather step up and change this or just keep on living a life where many people suffer in the hands of poverty due to inaccessible education? <b>You</b> can change this. Sign up below to join the cause and advocate for fair quality education.</p>
